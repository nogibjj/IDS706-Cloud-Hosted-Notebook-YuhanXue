## Data Manipulation
The following data manipulation is performed:
1. Load the dataset (`diabetes.csv`) by pulling from a GitHub repository.
2. Explore the data by showing the head, tail and high-level statistics (e.g. min, max, average, etc.)
3. Visualize the data by plotting a sample bar graph between attribute `Age` and `BMI`.
4. Filtering out data point that has `Age` between 30 and 50 and plot the same graph to show manipulation is successful.
5. Manipulate the data by sorting it in descending order according to `Age`.
